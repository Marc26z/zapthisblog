So I've worked on this cashu cards idea for a few thousand blocks. The plan is to sell them, while also keeping them open source. I had many of these ideas swarming around in my head for tens of thousands of blocks and fighting with doubt. That's the ultimate final boss. We, bitcoiners have the power to use bitcoin as a 

- Store of value
- Medium of exchange
- Unit of account.

Nostr gives us the power to speak feeely. That's an often underlooked aspect of this new protocol. Bitcoin is great for sending value, but it's not tue most efficient waybto communicate. There are ways to add messages to the base-chain, but that's not robust enough to build a marketplace. The marketplace consists of people speaking and exccnging value. Nostr provides us this value.

Since we are free to communicate witout censorship on nostr, we are free to use the protocol for almost anything we can imagine. It's a public space witthout communication restrictions and information verification system with a web of trust and active development. Think of all the bitcoin merch on Etsy. There are posters, T-shirts, coffee cups and more sold on the government/corporate controlled Internet.I'm selling merch on nostr to show them how to sell merch on nostr.

## Birthday Cards And Other Stuff

[Wait, But Why‚úè](https://store.waitbutwhy.com/?_gl=1*1htzlnj*_ga*NTY5NDE2MzYxLjE3NDYzODY2MDM.*_ga_75HVGHEY0J*MTc0NjM4NjYwMy4xLjAuMTc0NjM4NjYwMy4wLjAuMA..) is a blog from Tim Urban who has a unique perapective on life. He sells Birthday Cards, Christmas cards, plush toys and coffee cups on this blog. I always thought it was cool that he monitized his articles by his inspired me to sell some of my own greeting cards, coffee cups, and other stuff. I'm building a store like that for my blog, but I want sats, obviously...So I printed some [birthday cards](https://cashucards.zapthisblog.com/) at an actual print shop and was shocked at how great they looked. Now I'm selling some on my store. 
I'm selling them for 15,000 sats, but each card recieves 1,000 sats in Cashu(in the form of a QR code inside the card) I plan to donate some sats to cashu project and split up the profits with BitPopart who desigbed the cartoon characters. I would like to use zapsplits in Shopstr. I hear the NIP is easy to implment. I should vibe code it or something. Nevertheless, I'm using sats as a medium of exchange, store of value, ans unit of account. If bitcoin jumps over the moon, I'll need to adjust my prices. I have some ideas for other stuff to sell too. I prefer making as much as I can by myself. I'm not using a loom to make shirts, but I want to make t-shirts with Custom QR codes and nostr art.

### Shop My Store

...So check out my store at https://shopstr.zapthisblog.com. It will help support me writing this blog, give me bitcoin IT experience, and make me feel like I'm contributing something of value to the bitcoin movement. My goal is for plebs to use these cards to educate their children, family snd friends. How many times have you heard, "Bitcoin is just a speculative asset." Bitcoin is an abstract idea built from abstract math, a slad of computer science, Austrian Economics, obscure political philosophy, and a branch of mathmatics they don't teach you in high school.

Don't say, "buy bitcoin." Show people bitcoin is used like money. Give them something they can see, touch, and use. They can scan the QR code and watch the sats appear on their phone by magic with a message: Happy Birthday!
