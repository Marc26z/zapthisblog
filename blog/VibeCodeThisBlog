# Vibe Code This Blog

![ZapThisBlog](https://github.com/Marc26z/zapthisblog/blob/main/pictures/zappyzap.png?raw=true)

In high school, the cool kids were into football, pagers, and weed. I was into sonnets written by William H. Shakespeare. In other words, I was a dork. I did dorky stuff like write poetry. I recently used MKStacks with dork, but there's a new way to Vibe Code nostr clients, Shakesphere DIY.

## Sonnet 130

`My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
And in some perfumes is there more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
That music hath a far more pleasing sound;
I grant I never saw a goddess go;
My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground.
   And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
   As any she belied with false compare.
` 
I wrote my own sonnets with iambic pentameter and rhymes, gave them to girls out of my league, and got rejected and laughed at. I never had a date in high school because girls around me liked tattoos more than poetry. I'm sure that is why [I compare Satoshi's white paper to poetry](https://tinyurl.com/bitcoinispoetry). To a poet, everything looks like a poem. Even if I am bias, I do think software is an artform. Writing code is not much different than writing poetry. Some of the best developers I know write clean code. Clean code might as well be poetry for nerds, Tools like shakesphere.diy can make nerd poets of us all.

## Shakesphere DIY

[Shakesphere DIY](https://shakespeare.diy/) is a website made by the team at [SoapBox](https://soapbox.pub/). I used it to vibe code a simple nostr client. I asked it to:

```
make me a blog website named zap this blog that shows the the NIP-23 kind:30023 posts from this npub: npub1marc26z8nh3xkj5rcx7ufkatvx6ueqhp5vfw9v5teq26z254renshtf3g0.

I made some edits like [make the UI Repsonsive and mobile friendly](https://tinyurl.com/maketheUI). and `render markdown into html.` I made chaged the theme color to purple and black. I searched for long-form content on [nostrhub.io](https://nostrhub.io) to learn the kinds I needed to add.

Code is speech and cypherpunk's write code, but we are nostriches. Speech is speech and we write speech. We do not care if you like what we say. We say it anyway. And when you do that, you can create a website. It doesn't require anyone's permission. You can host it yourself if you are so inclined. 

Vibe code is speech, nostriches write vibe code.
Vibe code does not care if you approve it.
A nostr identity is vibe code.
nostr is math that can't be arrested.

Words are spoeech and speech is free on nostr
People can pay you sats for shitposting.
You can vibe code your merch store named storestr
You don't even need to pay for hosting.



....See. I told you I was a dork. Anyway, anyone who can write a paragraph can now write code using [Shakespeare diy](https://shakespeare.diy/). Here are some of the [cool nostr clients](https://soapbox.pub/blog/shakespeare-1-week-update) plebs like yourself have already built. I still need to go back and fix some of the pictures on some of my previous posts, but I'm eliminating some of the self hosted stuff because all of that takes too much time. Creating a blog like this eliminates the need to cross post on [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) and nostr. I will just post this on Substack to I can increase my reach and still be nostr only-ish.

You can check out [my new vibe coded blog here](https://zap-blog-nostr-1qpu.shakespeare.to/).  You should try vibe coding something for yourself. Learn about nostr. It's not just to replace social media anymore. It's about creating an Internet of the people, by the people, and fore the people. There is no set up. No command line ninja skills required. If you can understand nips and kinds on [nostrhub](https://nostrhub.io/), you can vibe code your own nostr app. Don't expect it to compete with Damus or Primal, but you can make a personal blogging site for about 21,000 sats. Shakesphere also takes credit cards, but you can pay with bitcoin over the lightning network too.
